# Front End README / Program Description
1. __Primary Front End (REACT) code file is src/App.jsx__
2. __Primary backend code is APP.js (NODE.JS), located in the backend repo__

* This is the simplest app we could come up with
  * see collaborators for both repos
* its intention was to introduce the basics of full stack development using React and Node Javascript.
* This app accepts text through an input box and submit button.     
* The front end code tracks data in the input box and sends submitted fields to the backend server.
  * see backend repo for this code
* The backend server recieves these values and returns the same text back to the UI
* The front end then prints the returned data on the screen
* Each time the server is reset, the data fields are reset
  * We are not using a database or file logging system because this program accepts dummy data
